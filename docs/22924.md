# Classes, classes, classes!
- We're going to be creating a class!

---
# 1. init() and getBuildingInfo()
- We're going to implement `init()` and `getBuildingInfo()` methods first
    - We will then create a quick driver, called `Driver1.java`    

---

# 2. Getters & Setters
- Let's create a getter and setter for the name!
    - We need these because of private variables :)
    - Let's call them `getName()` and `setName()`
    - Let's create another driver: `Driver2.java`

---
# 3. Let's Add Some Statics
- We will add in a static variable called: `numberOfBuildings`
    - Why do we need this?
- We can add a getter for this: `getNumberOfBuildings()`
- Let's make a driver for this too: `Driver3.java`

---

# 4. Constructors, Constructors, Constructors!!! (and a toString())
- Let's add something called a constructor (or two, or three...)
    - This is awfully similar to something we wrote before!
- Let's finish it off with a `toString()`

---
# Thank you! Any questions?
