# File I/O 
- Let's go over some basic File I/O things.
    - Import in `TextFiles.zip` from the class website along with `TextFiles.pdf`
---
## Text Files
- Human-readable data representation
- Can be edited with text editors (Notepad, VS Code)
- Characters stored with specific encoding (UTF-8, ASCII)
- Examples: .java, .txt, .html files

## Binary Files
- Stored as sequence of bytes (not human-readable)
- More compact and efficient for large data
- Used for images, audio, video, compiled programs

---

# Key Difference: Text vs Binary I/O

- **Text I/O**: Involves character encoding/decoding
  - More overhead but human-readable
  - Appropriate for configuration, source code, logs

- **Binary I/O**: Directly manipulates raw bytes
  - Faster and more efficient
  - Better for multimedia, large datasets

Note: All files are ultimately stored in binary at hardware level

# File I/O 
- Let's go over some basic File I/O things (again).
    - Import in `BinaryFiles.zip` from the class website along with `BinaryFiles.pdf`

# Classes for Text File I/O

Java provides **Readers** and **Writers** for text data:

## Reading Text Files
- **FileReader** – Basic character reading
- **BufferedReader** – Efficient buffered reading

## Writing Text Files
- **FileWriter** – Basic character writing
- **BufferedWriter** – Efficient buffered writing
- **PrintWriter** – Formatted text output

---

# Why Use Readers/Writers?

- Automatic character encoding handling
- More convenient for text processing
- Buffered versions improve efficiency

---

# The File Class

Represents file/directory paths and properties (not content)

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `exists()` | Checks if file/directory exists |
| `delete()` | Deletes file/directory |
| `createNewFile()` | Creates new empty file |
| `isFile()/isDirectory()` | Checks type |
| `getName()` | Returns filename |
| `length()` | Returns file size (bytes) |
| `renameTo(File)` | Renames file/directory |

---

# FileReader

Basic character-based file reading:

```java
FileReader reader = new FileReader("input.txt");
int character;
while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
    System.out.print((char)character);
}
reader.close();
```

- Reads one character at a time
- Handles Unicode automatically
- Not efficient for large files (no buffering)

---

# BufferedReader

Efficient text file reading with buffering:

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
    new FileReader("input.txt"));
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
reader.close();
```

- Reads in larger chunks for better performance
- `readLine()` reads entire lines at once

---

# Scanner

Token-based text file reading:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("data.txt"));
while (scanner.hasNext()) {
    String name = scanner.next();
    int age = scanner.nextInt();
    double gpa = scanner.nextDouble();
    // Process data
}
scanner.close();
```

- Parses input into tokens (default delimiter: whitespace)
- Built-in methods for different data types: `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc.

---

# FileWriter

Basic character writing to files:

```java
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt");
writer.write("Hello, World!");
writer.close();
```

- Writes characters to a file
- Creates file if it doesn't exist
- Simple but not buffered

---

# BufferedWriter

Efficient text file writing with buffering:

```java
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(
    new FileWriter("output.txt"));
writer.write("Hello, World!");
writer.newLine();
writer.write("Another line");
writer.close();
```

- Improves performance by writing in chunks
- `newLine()` adds platform-dependent line separators

---

# PrintWriter

Formatted text output to files:

```java
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("output.txt");
writer.println("Hello, World!");
writer.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", "John", 25);
writer.close();
```

- Convenient methods similar to System.out
- Formatted output with printf()
- Can auto-flush when used with System.out
