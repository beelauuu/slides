# 1D Array Problems
- Download the `ArrayIntroExercise.zip` from the website (Week 9)
- Import it into Eclipse and let's work on these problems together.
    - Some of these methods will be very similar to what you are going to see on your project :) 
        - As a result, I am not posting the code on the website.
    - Work together on these and I'll go over them after.
- We have tests for this exercise too! Check out the submit server.
