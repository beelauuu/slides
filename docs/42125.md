# Priority Queues (PQ)
- Let's go over the concepts of Priority Queues in Java
- Import in the `JCFpQueue.zip` file from the class website as well!
---

# What is a Priority Queue?

- A specialized queue where elements are dequeued based on **priority**, not FIFO order
- Each element has an associated priority value
- The element with highest/lowest priority is always removed first
- Most implementations use a **heap data structure**

**Key Concepts:**
- Optimized for fast access to highest/lowest priority element
- Not designed for keeping the entire collection sorted
- Common operations: insert, peek, remove

---

# How Priority Queues Work

**Real-world analogy: To-do list with task urgency**
- "Finish project" (high priority)
- "Watch TV" (low priority)

Priority queue ensures "Finish project" is handled first, even if "Watch TV" was added earlier

**Under the hood:**
- Typically implemented as a binary heap
- **Min-heap**: Smallest element dequeued first
- **Max-heap**: Largest element dequeued first (via custom comparator)

# PriorityQueue in Java

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
```

**Constructors:**
```java
PriorityQueue<>();  // Default - natural ordering
PriorityQueue<>(Comparator<? super E> comparator);  // Custom ordering
PriorityQueue<>(Collection<? extends E> c);  // From collection
```

**Key Methods:**
- `add(E e)`, `offer(E e)` - Insert element
- `peek()` - View highest priority element without removal
- `poll()` - Remove and return highest priority element
- `remove()` - Remove highest priority element (throws exception if empty)

---

# Behavior and Use Cases

**Default Behavior:**
- Orders elements using their `compareTo()` method (natural ordering)
- For custom objects, must implement `Comparable` or provide a `Comparator`

**Common Use Cases:**
- Task scheduling by priority/deadline
- CPU scheduling in operating systems
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Event-driven simulations
- Network packet routing (QoS)

---

# Customizing Priority

**Creating a max-heap (reverse ordering):**
```java
// Max-heap of integers
PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(
    (a, b) -> b - a  // Reverses natural ordering
);
```
---
**For custom objects:**
```java
// Option 1: Make class implement Comparable
public class Task implements Comparable<Task> {
    private int priority;
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Task other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.priority, other.priority);
    }
}

// Option 2: Provide a custom Comparator
PriorityQueue<Task> taskQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(
    Comparator.comparingInt(Task::getPriority)
);
```
