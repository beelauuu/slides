# Java Review 
- Download and import the `Review.zip` and let's go over it
    - Important takeaways:
        - Difference between the three types of copies (Reference, Shallow, Deep)
        - Encapsulation: Putting your important things in a box and then locking it. We only give access through keys (getter and setter)
            - Prevents privacy leaks :) 
        - Static variables
        - Equals Method

# Inheritance!
- Download and import the `TVCode.zip` and let's go over some basics of inheritance
    - Important takeaways:
        - Java is a very careful language, things will compile if and only if we can **guarantee** it is safe.
        - Understand difference between compile time and run time
            - Things that might be safe at compile time (before the program is executed) might not be safe at run time.
