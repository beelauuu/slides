1. Project 2 Questions
    - Make sure you're submitting with the submit server plugin!
2. Programs! (again)
    - We'll write these ones together (practicing while/do-while loops)
3. Office Hours / Lecture Review

    - Note: it's 11:30 not 11:59 
- Remind Brian of your name

# Loop Programs
- We're going to be doing programs now!
    - Featuring loops this time (while and do-while)
    - We'll write it together but you're going to help 

---
# 1. Evens
- Write a program that reads two integer values and prints the even values in the specified range. Use the `%` operator to determine whether a value is even.
    - Assume the first number they pass in is less than the second number

---

# 2. Odds
- Write a program that computes the sum of odd values between two integer values, a and b. 
    - If a > b, no processing will occur, and the program will print the message "Invalid Range."

---
# 3. Password
- Write a program that asks a user for an expected password ("terps") and keeps asking the user for the password until "terps" is provided. 
    - The program will print the message "Invalid Password" whenever an invalid password is provided.
    - The program will print the message "Login successful" when the expected password is provided
- Let's use a do-while for this one :)
---
# 4. Rewrite me
- Rewrite the following program using a while loop.

        int age;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter age: ");

            age = scanner.nextInt();
            if (age < 0) {
                System.out.println("Wrong value.");
            }
        } while (age < 0);

        System.out.println("Correct value provided. " + age);
        scanner.close();
