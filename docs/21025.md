# JUnit Testing

- JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java.
- It allows developers to write and run automated tests to ensure code correctness.
- In CMSC131/CMSC132, we'll cover some basic assertions and writing simple JUnit tests for your student tests.

---
# The Three Assertions You Ever Need

- JUnit provides several assertion methods to verify expected outcomes.
- The most common ones are:
    - `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Asserts that two values are equal.
    - `assertTrue(condition)`: Asserts that a condition is true.
    - `assertFalse(condition)`: Asserts that a condition is false.

---
# Writing a Basic JUnit Test
- To write a JUnit test:
    - Create a new Java class in your test folder.
    - Import JUnit and any necessary classes.
    - **Write methods annotated with @Test.**
    - Use assertion methods to verify expected behavior.

---
# Example of a Basic JUnit Test:
```
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class MyMathTest {
    
    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        int result = MyMath.add(3, 4);
        assertEquals(7, result);
    }
}
```
---
# Running Tests
- In Eclipse, to run JUnit tests:
    - Right-click on your test class.
    - Select Run As > JUnit Test.
    - View the test results in the JUnit tab.
---
# Summary
- JUnit is a testing framework for Java.
- Use `assertEquals()`, `assertTrue()`, and `assertFalse()` for basic assertions.
- Write test methods annotated with @Test.
    - Please please please make sure you do this. This is very forgettable and has caused many hours of pain and suffering for people (including me).
- Run tests using Eclipse's JUnit runner.

# Memory Diagrams
A **memory diagram** is a visual representation of how data is stored in memory during program execution. It helps us understand:
- The difference between **stack** and **heap** memory
- How variables reference objects
- The lifetime and scope of variables

It'll make more sense when we draw a couple out, so let's start!

---
# Example 1:
```
public class Driver {
    
 public static int sumOfSquares(int x, int y) {
    int answer;
    answer = x * x + y * y;
    /* HERE */
    return answer;
 }

 public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 3, b = 4, result;
    result = sumOfSquares(a, b);
    System.out.println("Answer: " + result);
 }

}
```
