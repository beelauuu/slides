# Slides, slides, slides
- Angelyn made a cool little review slideset that we'll try and run through.
    - It's a lot so I'll try to cover it all.

# One Last Goodbye!
- Thanks for sticking out discussions with me. It's been amazing to be apart of your journey to be a computer scientist :) 
    - We did NOT get a 70%+ response rate on the course evaluations but I brought cookies anyways because I like you guys.
        - Please fill it out though if you get a chance :(
- Good luck on the final you're all going to do great!
