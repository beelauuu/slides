# Threads 
- Let's go over more Thread concepts in Java
- Import in the `Threads2.zip` file from the class website as well!
---
## Data Race: Definition

A data race occurs when:
- Two or more threads access the same shared variable/resource
- At least one access is a write operation
- The accesses are not properly synchronized

---

## Thread Memory Model

- Each thread has its own **stack** (local variables, method calls)
- Threads share the **heap** (objects, collections, arrays)
- Shared mutable objects can lead to data races

---

## Why Data Races Are Problematic

- Thread execution order is unpredictable
- Can lead to different results on each run
- Bugs are:
  - Intermittent
  - Hard to reproduce
  - Difficult to debug

---

## Data Race Example

```java
public class DataRace extends Thread {
    static int common = 0;
    
    public void run() {
        int local = common; // data race: read
        local = local + 1;
        common = local;     // data race: write
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int max = 3;
        DataRace[] allThreads = new DataRace[max];
        for (int i = 0; i < allThreads.length; i++)
            allThreads[i] = new DataRace();
            
        for (DataRace thread : allThreads)
            thread.start();
            
        for (DataRace thread : allThreads)
            thread.join();
            
        System.out.println(common); // May not be 3
    }
}
```

---

## Data Race Hidden Complexities

- Even `common++` is not atomic!
  - It's actually three operations:
    1. Read common from memory
    2. Increment the value
    3. Write the result back to memory
  
- A thread can be interrupted between these steps
- Results in lost updates and inconsistent state

---

## Sequential vs Concurrent Execution

Sequential:
- Thread 1: Reads 0, adds 1, writes 1
- Thread 2: Reads 1, adds 1, writes 2
- Thread 3: Reads 2, adds 1, writes 3
- Result: 3

Concurrent (possible case):
- Thread 1: Reads 0, adds 1
- Thread 2: Reads 0, adds 1
- Thread 3: Reads 0, adds 1
- All write 1
- Result: 1

---

## Synchronization

**Definition**: Ensures coordinated execution of threads in concurrent environments

**Key Properties**:
- Prevents data races
- Incurs runtime overhead
- Requires careful balance (excessive synchronization hurts performance)

---

## Locks in Java

A lock ensures exclusive access to a critical section:

**Key Properties**:
- Enforces mutual exclusion
- Only one thread can hold a lock at any time
- Other threads block until the lock is released

**Critical Section**: Code that accesses shared resources

---

## Intrinsic Locks in Java

- Every Java object has an associated intrinsic lock (monitor lock)
- Used with the `synchronized` keyword
- Provides mutual exclusion for critical sections

---

## Using the synchronized Keyword

```java
Object lock = new Object(); // Any object can be a lock

synchronized(lock) {
    // Critical section
    // Only one thread can be here at a time
}  // Lock is automatically released
```

**Lock Behavior**:
- Acquire: Thread gets the lock if available
- Block: Thread waits if lock is held by another thread
- Release: Lock is freed when block exits (even via exception)

---

## Fixing the Data Race Example

```java
public class NoDataRace extends Thread {
    static int common = 0;
    static Object lock = new Object();
    
    public void run() {
        synchronized(lock) {
            int local = common;
            local = local + 1;
            common = local;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Same as before but now protected by synchronization
        // Result will always be 3
    }
}
```

---

## Synchronized Methods in Java

Shorthand for synchronizing an entire method using the current object's lock:

```java
// Shorthand
public synchronized void deposit(double amount) {
    balance += amount;
}

// Equivalent expanded form
public void deposit(double amount) {
    synchronized(this) {
        balance += amount;
    }
}
```

Notes:
- For instance methods, locks on `this`
- For static methods, locks on the Class object
- Ensures mutual exclusion for the entire method

---

## Synchronization Approaches (Bank Account Example)

1. **External lock object**:
   ```java
   Object lockObj = new Object();
   synchronized(lockObj) { account.withdraw(amount); }
   ```

2. **Using account as lock**:
   ```java
   synchronized(account) { account.withdraw(amount); }
   ```

3. **Internal lock in account class**:
   ```java
   private final Object lockObj = new Object();
   public void withdraw(double amount) {
       synchronized(lockObj) { /* implementation */ }
   }
   ```
---
4. **Using this as lock in account class**:
   ```java
   public void withdraw(double amount) {
       synchronized(this) { /* implementation */ }
   }
   ```

5. **Synchronized methods**:
   ```java
   public synchronized void withdraw(double amount) {
       /* implementation */
   }
