# Linked List
- Let's wrap up 2 methods from the `LListRecursion.Zip`
    1. `deleteAux()`
    2. `findMax()` and `findMaxAux()`
---
# Insertion Sort + Clone
- Let's go over another type of sort + cloning!
    - Import in `SortAndClone.pdf` from the class website along with `Lab1Week8.zip`

# Insertion Sort

- **Concept**: Builds a sorted section one element at a time
- **Analogy**: Like sorting a hand of playing cards
- **Process**:
  1. Assume first element is sorted 
  2. Take next element, compare with sorted part
  3. Shift elements to make space if needed
  4. Repeat until fully sorted
- Essentially, the array is split into a "sorted" and "unsorted" side
---

# Insertion Sort: Example

Sorting `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`:

1. **Pass 1**: Insert 3 into [5]
   - Shift: [5, 5, 8, 4, 2]
   - Insert: [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]

2. **Pass 2**: Insert 8 into [3, 5]
   - No shifts needed: [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]

---

# Insertion Sort: Example (cont.)

3. **Pass 3**: Insert 4 into [3, 5, 8]
   - Shift: [3, 5, 8, 8, 2]
   - Shift: [3, 5, 5, 8, 2]
   - Insert: [3, 4, 5, 8, 2]

4. **Pass 4**: Insert 2 into [3, 4, 5, 8]
   - Multiple shifts: [3, 3, 4, 5, 8]
   - Insert: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Note: Starting from end of sorted part combines searching and shifting into one pass!

---

# Insertion Sort: Complexity

- **Worst-case (O(n²))**: Array in reverse order
  - Every element must be compared and shifted

- **Best-case (O(n))**: Array already sorted
  - Each element compared once

- **Average-case (O(n²))**: Elements inserted in middle of sorted section

- **Space Complexity (O(1))**: In-place sorting

# The clone Method in Java

- **Purpose**: Creates a copy of an object
- **Defined in java.lang.Object**:
  ```java
  protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
  ```

- **Access Modifiers**: Protected → Subclasses need override to make public.
    - This is intentional. `clone()` is a powerful command if given by default.
- **Returns**: A new object that is a copy of the original
- **Throws**: CloneNotSupportedException if class doesn't implement Cloneable

---

# Cloneable Interface & Shallow Copy

- **Marker Interface**: No methods, just signals a property
  - Cloneable is a marker interface for clone() operation
  - Without it, clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

- **Shallow Copy by Default**:
  - Primitive fields are copied as-is
  - Reference fields (arrays, objects) copy reference only
  - For deep copy, must override clone() and copy referenced objects
