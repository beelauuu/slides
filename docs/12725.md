# Eclipse Basics
- Basic terminology (workspace, project, etc)
1. Workspace: Folder where Eclipse stores your projects, settings, and preferences
    - Central hub for all your Eclipse projects
2. Project: Container for your code and resources
    - Contains your packages and the libraries associated with it
3. Package: Folder structure to organize related classes
    - Contains your `.java` files

- The heiarchy goes workspace -> project -> package

4. Perspective: Predefined layout in Eclipse tailored for specific tasks
    - Java Perspective: For coding and running Java applications
    - Debug Perspective: For debugging your code

---

# Brian's Java Review
- Download the `Code` for Discussion 1 from [here](https://teaching.beelau.dev/) and let's run over some of it!
- You should be relatively comfortable with everything there 
    - Obviously, you'll be rusty and that's ok! 
    - We're going to review some more next time too

# Thank you! Any questions?
