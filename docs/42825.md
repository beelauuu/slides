# Threads 
- Let's go over the concepts of Threads in Java
- Import in the `ThreadsI.zip` file from the class website as well!
---

## Multitasking Basics

- **Process**: Instance of a computer program currently executing
- **Multitasking**: Gives illusion of multiple processes running simultaneously
- CPU switches rapidly between tasks, managed by OS scheduler
- With multiple CPUs, true parallel execution is possible

---

## Why Use Multitasking?

- Improves performance by utilizing idle time
- Better resource utilization
- Enhanced user experience with responsive applications

---

## Processes vs Threads

**Process**:
- Executable program with its own memory space
- Independent variables and data structures
- Communicates via OS, files, or network

**Thread**:
- "Lightweight process" within a program
- Shares memory with other threads in the same process
- Each has its own execution context but shares the heap

---

## Why Use Threads?

- **Natural Modeling**: Many systems involve multiple concurrent tasks
  - Example: Web server handling multiple user requests

- **Performance Benefits**:
  - Better hardware utilization on multi-core systems
  - Improved responsiveness
  - Efficient handling of mixed workloads

---

## Creating Threads in Java - Approach 1

**Extending Thread class** (not recommended):

```java
public class MyT extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

MyT t = new MyT();
t.start(); // Creates new thread and runs in parallel
```

Limitations:
- Java only allows single inheritance
- Mixes "what to do" with "how to run it"

---

## Creating Threads in Java - Approach 2

**Implementing Runnable interface** (preferred):

```java
public class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task is running");
    }
}

// Alternative 1
Thread t = new Thread(new MyTask());
t.start();

// Alternative 2
// Submit to an executor service
```

---

## Java Thread Lifecycle States

- **New**: Created but not started
- **Runnable**: Ready to run, waiting for CPU time
- **Running**: Currently executing (part of Runnable state)
- **Blocked**: Waiting for monitor lock
- **Waiting**: Waiting indefinitely for another thread
- **Timed Waiting**: Waiting with a time limit
- **Terminated**: Completed execution

---

## Thread State Transitions

```
                 scheduler
   New ------> Runnable <-----> Running ------> Terminated
                  ^               |
                  |               v
                  +------ Blocked/Waiting
```

- Transitions triggered by method calls or system events
- Platform-dependent scheduling

---

## Thread Scheduling in Java

- Platform-dependent (JVM and OS)
- Most systems use **preemptive scheduling**:
  - OS can interrupt threads to switch between them
  - Enables responsive multitasking

- Java provides no guarantees about scheduling policy
- Write code that works regardless of scheduling style

---

## Waiting for Thread Completion: join()

```java
Thread t1 = new Thread(task1);
Thread t2 = new Thread(task2);

// Start all threads first
t1.start();
t2.start();

// Then join on each one
t1.join();  // Main thread waits for t1 to finish
t2.join();  // Then waits for t2 to finish
```

WRONG approach: `t1.start(); t1.join(); t2.start(); t2.join();`  
This runs threads sequentially, not in parallel!

---

## Stopping a Thread Safely

- Thread ends naturally when run() completes
- **Don't use**: stop() method (deprecated, unsafe)
- **Recommended**: interrupt() method
  - Signals thread to stop at next convenient point
  - Thread must check for interruption

```java
public void run() {
    while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
        // Perform work here
    }
    // Clean up resources
}
```

---

## Thread Interruption Pattern

```java
// In one thread
thread.interrupt();

// In the target thread's run method
public void run() {
    try {
        while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
            // Normal processing
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle interruption during blocking operations
    } finally {
        // Clean up code
    }
}
```
