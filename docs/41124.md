# Interfaces, Interfaces, Interfaces!
- What is an interface?
    - A reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, and static methods  
    - Interfaces cannot contain instance fields. and methods in interfaces are abstract by default (they do not have a body)
- Interface vs. Classes?
    - Classes are the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
    - Interfaces, on the other hand, define a contract or a set of methods that a class agrees to implement. 
        - Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”instead, they must be implemented by classes (or extended by other interfaces).
- Let's go over `InterfacesLab.zip` now!
    - As always, code will go up on the website after
