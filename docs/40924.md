# ArrayList and File IO
- Import the `ArrayListFileCode.zip` into your Eclipse and lets go over it!
- Main points:
    - ArrayLists are like arrays but with dynamic size
        - Meaning they do not have a set size!
    - If you need to read file input/output, refer back to the code examples. They are how you will do it in project 7
        - There are a LOT of different ways to accomplish it, but this is the "easiest" way for you guys
    - To sort, it usually goes by natural ordering (ex: alphabetical), but you can specify a comparator if you want to change the order it's sorting by
        - Or if you have a custom class you want to sort, you need to make sure it implements Comparable and define the `compareTo()` method
