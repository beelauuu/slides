- `Quiz 3 (Memory Maps)`
    - `Wednesday March 13th, 2024`
- Remind Brian of your name!

# Memory Diagrams
- Quick review and then let's draw 3 examples
---
# Example 1:
```
public class Driver {
    
 public static int sumOfSquares(int x, int y) {
    int answer;
    answer = x * x + y * y;
    /* HERE */
    return answer;
 }

 public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 3, b = 4, result;
    result = sumOfSquares(a, b);
    System.out.println("Answer: " + result);
 }

}
```

# Classes (again x2)
- This time about a doctor üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
- Let's implement it together!


---
# 1. Constructor
- Let's have a:
    - `name` field (String)
    - `speciality` field (String)
    - `yearsOfExperience` field (Integer)
    - `patientsSeen` field (StringBuffer)
- Let's only let them pass in name, speciality, and yearsOfExperience

---

# 2. toString()
- Let's create a way to see our doctors!
    - Keep in mind the return type of `toString()` is a STRING even though it is used while printing
- Make sure you follow the method heading **EXACTLY** as shown

---
# 3. seePatient()
- It will take in a string as the parameter representing a patient's name and adds the patient to the patientsSeen instance variable. 
    - If the name parameter is `null`, no addition will take place. 
    - Use the StringBuffer append method to add the patient's name

---
# 4. Two Parameter Constructor
- Let's add in another constructor now but one that only needs 2 parameters! (name, speciality)
    - We can reuse our old constructor to do this :)
---
# 5. Default Constructor
- Another constructor, but this time no parameters! 
    - Let's reuse our old constructors again :)
---
# 6. Copy Constructor
- Last constructor. Let's reuse our old constructor again
- Make a mental or physical note about objects sharing fields. It's important! 
    - We can see this with our StringBuffer
---
# 7. increaseExperience() 
- This will increase the experience by a value specified in the parameter. It returns the current object
    - What should our method header look like?
---
# 8. Getters and Setters
- Similar to what we had last time!
    - Let's just make it for our `speciality` variable
---
# 9. Private Methods / Clean Up
- Let's add in a private helper method to let us know if years of experience is valid (between 0 and 75)
    - We should use this in our constructors and increaseExperience() method
    - If it's invalid, no change for our years of experience will take place
---
# 10. Statics
- Last but not least, let's create one final static variable to keep track of how many doctors we have
    - Let's call it `count`
    - Let's also create a getter for this!
