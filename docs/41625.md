### Why did the array break up with quicksort and date merge sort instead? Because merge sort always splits things up just to bring them back together. üíî‚û°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

# MergeSort
- Let's go over the concepts of MergeSort
- Import in the `NLogNSort.zip` file from the class website as well!

# Introduction to Merge Sort

- Classic **divide-and-conquer** algorithm developed by John von Neumann (1945)
- Recursive approach with three steps:
  1. **Divide** the array into halves
  2. **Sort** each half recursively
  3. **Merge** the sorted halves

- **Key properties**:
  - Always runs in O(n log n) time
  - Stable sort (equal elements maintain original order)
  - Requires O(n) extra space

---

# Divide and Conquer - Three Steps

1. **Divide**
   - Split array into two halves

2. **Conquer**
   - Recursively sort each half

3. **Combine**
   - Merge the sorted halves

**Example**:
Original: [8, 4, 5, 2]
‚Üí Divide: [8, 4] and [5, 2]
‚Üí Sort: [4, 8] and [2, 5]
‚Üí Merge: [2, 4, 5, 8]

# Easy Split, Hard Merge

**Splitting is easy**:
- Compute midpoint: `mid = (left + right) / 2`
- No comparisons needed
- Just index arithmetic

**Merging is work-intensive**:
- Requires combining two sorted arrays
- Takes linear time, O(n)
- Needs extra space for temporary array

> Note: Merge Sort = Easy Split, Hard Merge
> QuickSort = Hard Split, Easy Merge

# Merge Sort Example

Sorting: [8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 10, 2]

**Divide Phase**:
- Split 1: [8, 3, 1, 7] and [0, 10, 2]
- Split 2: [8, 3] [1, 7] [0, 10] [2]
- Split 3: [8] [3] [1] [7] [0] [10] [2]

**Conquer and Merge Phase**:
- Merge: [8] [3] ‚Üí [3, 8]
- Merge: [1] [7] ‚Üí [1, 7]
- Merge: [0] [10] ‚Üí [0, 10]
- Merge: [3, 8] [1, 7] ‚Üí [1, 3, 7, 8]
- Merge: [0, 10] [2] ‚Üí [0, 2, 10]
- Final: [1, 3, 7, 8] [0, 2, 10] ‚Üí [0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10]

# Time Complexity: O(n log n)

- Each level splits array in half ‚Üí log‚ÇÇ(n) levels
- Each level processes all n elements ‚Üí O(n) work per level
- Total: O(n log n) operations

**For n = 8**:
- log‚ÇÇ(8) = 3 levels
- Work per level: O(8)
- Total work: 3 √ó 8 = 24 steps

**Recursion Tree**:
```
Level 0: [8 elements]
Level 1: [4] [4]
Level 2: [2] [2] [2] [2]
Level 3: [1][1] [1][1] [1][1] [1][1]
```

---

# Space Complexity: O(n)

**Merging Requires Extra Memory**:
- Temporary array during merge: up to n elements
- Recursion stack: O(log n)

**Total Space**: O(n)

**Notes**:
- In-place merge sort exists but is more complex and slower
- Linked list implementation can use O(1) extra space (pointer manipulation)

# Merge Step - Visual Walkthrough

Merging [3, 8] and [1, 7]:

```
[3, 8] [1, 7]
 ^      ^
Compare 3 vs 1 ‚Üí Take 1 ‚Üí [1]

[3, 8] [1, 7]
 ^        ^
Compare 3 vs 7 ‚Üí Take 3 ‚Üí [1, 3]

[3, 8] [1, 7]
    ^    ^
Compare 8 vs 7 ‚Üí Take 7 ‚Üí [1, 3, 7]

[3, 8] [1, 7]
    ^      
Only 8 remains ‚Üí [1, 3, 7, 8]
```

# Merge Sort Implementation

```java
void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        
        // Divide array
        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);
        
        // Merge sorted halves
        merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

void merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    // Create temporary arrays
    // Compare and copy elements in order
    // Copy remaining elements
}
```

# Merge Sort for Linked Lists

**Advantages**:
- No random access needed (sequential only)
- No swapping - just pointer manipulation
- Space-efficient merging (O(1) extra space)

**Implementation**:
- Split list using slow/fast pointer technique
- Recursively sort both halves
- Merge by relinking nodes

**Why preferred over QuickSort for lists**:
- QuickSort needs random access
- Merge Sort uses sequential-only operations

---

# External Merge Sort

**Problem**: Data too large to fit in memory

**Two-Phase Approach**:
1. **Create Sorted Runs**:
   - Read chunks that fit in memory
   - Sort each chunk
   - Write sorted chunks to disk

2. **Multi-Way Merge**:
   - Open multiple sorted runs
   - Merge using priority queue
   - Write merged result

**Applications**: Database systems, log processing, big data
