# Code Practice
- Download `Lab1Week9.zip` from the class website.
    - There are 2 (technically 3) methods for you to work on:
        1. `removeInRange()`
        2. `removeInRangeAux()`
        3. `mostFrequentWord()`
- Solutions will not be posted but I will go over them! Recording will still be posted as always
