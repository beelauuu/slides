# Number Bases
- Number bases represent the number of unique digits in a system.
    - ex: Base-7 has 7 unique digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
- Binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) are the most common for computer science.
- Today we'll go over two basic things:
    - Converting base-`x` numbers to base-10 (Easier)
    - Convering base-10 numbers to base-`x` (Harder, a little)
--- 
# What even is Base-10?
- Consider the number: 843
    - 843 = 8 * 100 + 4 * 10 + 3 * 1
    - We can also represent it slightly differently
--- 
# What even is Base-10?
- Consider the number: 843
    - 843 = 8 * 100 + 4 * 10 + 3 * 1
    - 843 = 8 * 10² + 4 * 10¹ + 3 * 10⁰
- Notice that in base 10, we use powers of 10!
    - We also only have digits 0-9 (10 digits)

# Translating To Base-10
- If we have a number in base 6, how many digits would we have?
---
# Translating To Base-10
- If we have a number in base 6, how many digits would we have?
    - Correct, we'll have 6! 
        - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
---
# Translating To Base-10
- If we have a number in base 6, how many digits would we have?
    - Correct, we'll have 6! 
        - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Now, in the same way we represented 843 in base 10, how would we represent a number like 253 in base 6?
    -Hint: Remember 843 = 8 * 10² + 4 * 10¹ + 3 * 10⁰

- Now, in the same way we represented 843 in base 10, how would we represent a number like 253₆?
    -Hint: Remember 843 = 8 * 10² + 4 * 10¹ + 3 * 10⁰

- 253₆ : 2 * 6² + 5 * 6¹ + 3 * 6⁰ = 105
    -Congrats, you just converted your first number to base-10

# Base-10 Exercises

- Try some for yourself now:
    1. 136₇ = __
    2. 423₅ = __

# Base-10 Exercises

- Try some for yourself now:
    1. 136₇ = 76 = 1 * 7² + 3 * 7¹ + 6 * 7⁰
    2. 423₅ = 113 = 4 * 5² + 2 * 5¹ + 3 * 5⁰

# Translating from Base-10 to Base-`a`

- Less intuitive, but there is a process you follow to convert numbers and you'll be ok
- The rationale for why it works is because it relies on the fundamental concept of place value and the way different bases represent numeric values using powers of the base.
    - Basically, a person centuries ago decided this when numbers were invented
---
# Translating from Base-10 to Base-`a`
- The process in question:
1. **Divide and Record**: Divide the number by the base and record the remainder.
2. **Repeat**: Repeat step 1 with the quotient until it becomes zero.
    - i.e: Something like 2 / 5 because 5 cannot go into 2 without talking about decimals
3. **Read in Reverse**: Read the remainders in reverse order to get the converted number.
- An example will make this (a lot) easier to swallow

# Example - Base 2 (Binary)

- Let's convert 25 (base-10) to binary (base 2).
---
# Example - Base 2 (Binary)
- Let's convert 25 (base-10) to binary (base 2).
- Step 1: 25 / 2 = 12 with a remainder of 1. 
    - Record the 1.
- Step 2: 12 / 2 = 6 with a remainder of 0. 
    - Record the 0.
- Step 3: 6 / 2 = 3 with a remainder of 0. 
    - Record the 0.
- Step 4: 3 / 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1. 
    - Record the 1.
- Step 5: 1 / 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1. 
    - Record the 1.
- Reading in reverse: 11001₂ 
    -Therefore, 25 in base 10 is 11001₂ in binary.
---
# Example - Base 5 
- Let's convert 52 (base-10) to base 5.
---
# Example - Base 5 
- Let's convert 52 (base-10) to base 5.
- Step 1: 52 / 5 = 10 with a remainder of 2. 
    - Record the 2.
- Step 2: 10 / 5 = 2 with a remainder of 0. 
    - Record the 0.
- Step 3: 2 / 5 = 0 with a remainder of 2. 
    - Record the 2.
- Reading in reverse: 202. Therefore, 52 in base 10 is 202₅

# Example - Base 16 (Hexadecimal)
- Wait, base 16? But we only have 9 numbers for digits
---
# Example - Base 16 (Hexadecimal)
- Wait, base 16? But we only have 9 numbers for digits
    - We use letters to represent bases greater than 10
- So for something like base 16, we need 6 additional letters to represent digits past 9.
    - Luckily, they just go in alphabetical order:
        - A = 10
        - B = 11
        - C = 12
        - D = 13
        - E = 14
        - F = 15
    - Remember there's no digit for `a` in base-`a`
        - We only go from digits 0-9 for base **10**
---
# Example - Base 16 (Hexadecimal)
- Now, we just do the same process! But the remainders >= 10, we sub out for the letters.
    -  Note that, this also applies from converting to from base 16 to base 10, we just use powers of 16 as our base and follow the same process

- Let's try this now:  
    ### Convert 189 (base 10) to base 16 (hexadecimal)
---
# Example - Base 16 (Hexadecimal)
- Let's convert 189 (base 10) to base 16 (hexadecimal)
- Step 1: 189 / 16 = 11 with a remainder of 13. 
    - Record D (representing 13 in hexadecimal)
- Step 2: 11 / 16 = 0 with a remainder of 11. 
    - Record B (representing 11 in hexadecimal)
- Reading in reverse: BD. Therefore, 189 in base 10 is BD in base 16 (hexadecimal).
