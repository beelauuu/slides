# Basic Programs
- We're going to be doing 3 small programs now!
    - Goal of this is to get practice with Java (duh)
    - Practice variables & using the Scanner class
- I will post my code for these after discussion on my website.
    - **THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T TRY WRITING THESE PROGRAMS**
    - You're only going to learn it if you try it.

# 1. Increasing Sequence
Write a program that reads three integer values and determines whether the values represent an increasing sequence. For example, 10, 20, 99 is an increasing sequence; 10, 5, 9 is not. The program will print “Increasing” when the sequence is increasing and “Not Increasing” otherwise.

---
# 2. Maximum Value
Write a program that reads three doubles values and determines the maximum value.

--- 

# 3. Grading Cutoffs
Write a program that reads in two double values, computes the average and displays a letter grade according to the following cutoffs:
- 90-100 A
- 80-89 B
- 70-79 C
- < 70 F
